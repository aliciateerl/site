I've been starting and stopping and restarting my first blog post for days. There are many reasons I could give for this, but  I think at the heart of it is my fear of making my writing public. This is something I'm fairly cognizant of, and precisely why I challenged myself to publish this blog, but still I'm finding it difficult to force myself to <i>put myself out there</i>. This has also manifested in a dissatisfaction with anything I've written - feeling like it must be polished, perfect, articulate, before it's ready to be put up on something as permanent as the scary online. But precisely because this is holding me back, I've decided to swing the absolute opposite way. My posts will be short, raw, unpolished. My only baseline are words. The lower my requirements, the more I will post, and the better I will get (or so I hope). At the end of the day, this is an indulgent undertaking intended to humor myself - I doubt that what I have to say is of that much value or interest to anyone else.

So here it is - imperfect, simple, and ultimately not very informative, but this helps me get over the scary hurdle of first post. May the rest come faster, more frequently, and with less fear.
